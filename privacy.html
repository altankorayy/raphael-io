<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the Raphael: AI Image Generator app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Altan Koray Benli (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
<p>The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
  <li>The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages</li>
  <li>The time spent on the Application</li>
  <li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, when you choose to upload your own photo for image generation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your uploaded photo is stored securely by the Application to avoid repeated uploads on subsequent uses.</li>
  <li>The stored photo is only accessed by the Application when generating a new AI-based image.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

<p>The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of in below ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Geolocation Services: The Service Provider utilizes location data to provide features such as personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.</li>
  <li>Analytics and Improvements: Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider to analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.</li>
  <li>Third-Party Services: Periodically, the Service Provider may transmit anonymized location data to external services. These services assist them in enhancing the Application and optimizing their offerings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.</p>

<p>For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to UserID. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<strong>Face Data and User Photos</strong>
<p>The Application includes features that utilize facial data and user-uploaded photos. Facial data (image scans, feature maps) is considered <em>biometric data</em> under applicable law:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Legal Basis & Consent:</strong> We process your biometric data only after obtaining your explicit consent. You can withdraw consent at any time via the app’s Help Center or by emailing <a href="mailto:altankoraybenli@gmail.com">altankoraybenli@gmail.com</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> Any face data captured in real-time (e.g., camera preview) is processed solely on your device and is <strong>not retained</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Uploaded Photo Storage:</strong> Photos you upload for avatar or image generation are stored on Firebase Storage under the default security settings provided by Firebase. These are used only to streamline repeat usage and are <strong>not shared</strong> with third parties except as required for AI processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Transmission to AI Service:</strong> To generate your custom image, we share the URL of your stored photo with our AI image generation service. Only the photo URL is transmitted; no additional metadata or personal identifiers are shared.</li>
  <li><strong>Access, Correction & Erasure:</strong> You have the right to access, correct or request deletion of your face data and photos. Submit a request via the app’s Help Center or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:altankoraybenli@gmail.com">altankoraybenli@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within 30 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Controls:</strong> We rely on Firebase’s security measures for data protection, including access controls and encrypted connections.</li>
  <li><strong>Breach Notification:</strong> In the event of a data breach affecting facial data, we will notify affected users and authorities (e.g., KVKK, GDPR regulators) as required by law.</li>
  <li><strong>Children’s Biometric Data:</strong> We do not knowingly process biometric data of children under 13. For users aged 13–16, we obtain parental consent and provide additional transparency measures.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Third Party Access</strong>
<p>Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uploaded photos and biometric maps are transmitted <em>only</em> to the AI image generation service when you request creation.</li>
  <li>We maintain Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with our AI and storage providers for any cross-border transfers.</li>
  <li>The Application utilizes these third-party services (each with its own Privacy Policy):</li>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AdMob</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>

</ul>

<strong>Opt-Out Rights</strong>
<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>

<strong>Data Retention Policy</strong>

<p>The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Service Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete this data. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:altankoraybenli@gmail.com">altankoraybenli@gmail.com</a> so that we can take the necessary actions.</p>

<strong>Security</strong>
<p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.</p>

The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy and posting an in-app notification.
